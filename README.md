Checklist with a dynamic display of the next step
--------------------------------------------------

A basic **checklist** for a laboratory **supercritical CO2 extraction** system.
For manual control of the necessary steps without a high degree of automation.
Perhaps the high-pressure valves are not (yet) available or the process sequence has not yet been fully researched.

This **checklist** makes it easy to run through the process. The sequence can be fully automated later.

Installation
------------

Simply open with a **web browser** and the file can be edited with a **text editor**.
A single HTML file contains the CSS style and a JavaScript for dynamic processing.

Tested with Edge and Firefox on Windows and with Chrome on Android.

Usage
-----

1. Copy the single file to a working directory
2. Open the file with a web browser
3. The complete checklist is displayed
4. Click or touch on a single element to selected/unselected item
5. First select [Individual] for only one list item at a time
6. [Clear all] deletes all already marked points (after confirmation)

Demo
----

And this is what it looks like:

Notes
-----

This **Checklist** can be easily adapted and also be printed if necessary.
The idea is to quickly create a sequence for playing through individual steps.

I created the whole thing based on checklists for airplanes.
